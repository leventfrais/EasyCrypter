# Easy crypter - AES



## Introduction

### This is an easy file encrypter based on aes , openssl , writing with visual studio c++

### The basic data and salt value are given default. Help yourself to change the initial param in src code "EasyCrypter.h/getKey()" if you want a stronger and safer cryption key.



## How to use

### You can compile your own with compiler or straightly run the .exe . To encrypt or decrypt just input 'e' or 'd' and give the filename including extensions in two lines !



# Example

```cmd
e
test.jpg
```

```cmd
d
test.jpg
```





# Notices

# Don't know why it will collapse under release compiling mode. So make sure to compile it with debug. Up to update the crypter like adding rsa mod in or user interface or more :>
